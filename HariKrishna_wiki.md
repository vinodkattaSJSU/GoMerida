### XP Core Value - Simplicity

### Week #8<br>
The team has completed working on all the functionalities of the game and spent the week on refactoring the code removing unnecessary things from the code and making it simple to understand.The team also faced some difficulties while merging the code and respective patterns together and Github made it simple to integrate the code. The team now has a working game with simple implmentation.

### Week #7<br>
This week the team has worked on implementing design patterns and integrated code.Team decided on the have a simple Theme Music selected from several background musics.The team members decide to make the game simple and have a working game with design patterns.Based on the discussions, the team has decided to refactor the code and finalised on game start and game over images.

### Week #6<br>
This week the team has worked on implementing design patterns and integrated code. The game functionality was discussed further and in order to keep the game simple suggestions were given to refactor the code.The team members decide to make the game simple and have a working game with design patterns.


### Week #5<br>
This week the team has worked on choosing the design patterns to implement in the game. The team came up with several scenarious where design patterns could be implemented in the game and some of them were complicated.After further discussions team dediced not to have few patterns in order to keep the implementation simple and to have a working game with design patterns.

### Week #4<br>
The team decided on the usecases and flow of the game this week. To maintain Simplicity in the implementation team decided not to have some usecases as they could not be implemented in the time frame. Taking the Simplicity of the game into consideration,team decided to drop those usecases.

### Week #3<br>
This week, Team tried few samples and scenarios of greenfoot such as backgrounTd for the game and further discussed on the feasible bakgrounds. Team decided to implement a simple background that can align with game design and Theme.    

### Week #2<br>
This week, In order to keep the Game simple and avoid complexities in the implementation phase, Team decided not to go with MelonJs and finalised Greenfoot. Team decided to go through Greenfoot tutorials as using Greenfoot Game design can simplify the work in the next coming weeks. 

### Week #1<br>

* Maintained simplicity core value throughout the discussions on how the game is going to be. The members of the team decided to keep the Game simple and do the simplest thing that could work.<br/>
