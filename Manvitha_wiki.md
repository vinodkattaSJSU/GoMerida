## XP Core Value - Feedback:

### Week #8<br>
This week the team is working on the final version of the game and the final stages of updating the design patterns. The team is mostly focussing on refactoring the code. Multiple changes have been recommended by the team. THe recommendations and feedback have been taken into consideration and the team is now working on incorporating the changes. The team also faced some difficulties while merging the code and respective patterns together. Feedback from every team member on what code needs to be changed is taken into perspective. The feedback has been considered and changes have been incorporated in the game.

### Week #7<br>
This week the team is still working on implementing a part of the design patterns and mapping it to the game. The team has delivered another part of the functionality of the game - Sounds nad graphics of game. Each team member reviewed the sound effects and provided feedback on the backgorund music and sound effects of the game. Based on the feedback from everyone, the team has decided on the theme music and the images that have to be part of the game.

### Week #6<br>
This week the team has worked on implementing a part of the design patterns and map it to the game. The team delivered a part of the functionality of the game and each team member reviewed the same and provided feedback on the different ways to refactor the code. Based on the feedback, the team worked on improvising the patterns accordingly.

### Week #5<br>
This week the team has worked on choosing the design patterns to implement in the game. One of the challenges faced was to map which design patterns suits best to which problem. The team had discussion and each member gave feedback on the solution decided. The feedback from each of the team member was taken into consideration and implemented accordingly.

### Week #4<br>
The team gave inputs on usecases and flow of the game. The first decided on some usecases, out of which some usecases were not feasible to implement in the time frame that we have. This was proposed by on the teammates, and this feedback was taken into consideration and we dropped some use cases. 

In the process of building usecase diagrams and activity diagrams, the feedback of teammates has been taken innto consideration and modified accordingly.

### Week #3<br>
The team gave inputs on game design and we chose an infinite loop game with levels. THe feedback from all the team members was taken into consideration for selecting the game design.

### Week #2<br>
This week, the team discussed and provided inputs on the game engine to use in implementation. We chose melon js and tried some libraries. But, the team found some difficulties. So, based on the feedback from each team member, we are planning to explore the tutorials on Greenfoot.

### Week #1<br>
* The first week meet started off with brainstorming about the game ideas. We first wanted to create a game where it included switching from one game concept to another - like a potpourri of games - and provide an adventure where the user cannot anticipate the game in the next level.<br> 
* Team members provided feedback that it would be a challenge to implement multiple game scenarios with the time constraint. <br>
* Based on the team feedback, we decided on implementing a single theme throughout the game.<br>
