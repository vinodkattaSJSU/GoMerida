### UML diagram:
I am responsible for drawing the sequence diagram for the game.
### Design Pattern:
I chose to implement command pattern in the game.
## Week 1:
### Core Value: Eliminating Waste

* We researched for high graphic games which is not necessary for this project. We then came to know that  low graphic game would do good.
* Came up with unity 3D, phaser, construct2 game engines and explored. We came to know we should put more time on developing the game which wonâ€™t really help us focus on the key area of our project i.e., the design patterns.

##  Design Pattern
Will choose after design pattern class
##  Sequence diagram

## Week 2:
### Eliminating Waste:

* Team considered MelonJS game engine and gone through it. Later team finalized greenfoot for game development. 
## Week 3:
### Eliminating Waste:

* Team brought up many images for setting back-ground to the game. Eliminated some images which team felt are not feasible for the game. 
## Week 4:
### Eliminating Waste:

* Some usecases are eliminated considering the timely delivery of the project. 
## Week 5:
### Eliminating Waste:

* Initially thought of different design patterns to implement the code but we came on for final 5 design pattern that make our code work.
## Week 6:
### Eliminating Waste:

* Team thought of many design patterns to be included in the code but finalised on 5 design patterns with which we can implement the code easily and eliminated other design patterns as they are feasiblee with our code.
## Week 7:
### Eliminating Waste:

* Team had tried different BGMs for the and finalised on a BG music. Team integrated the game code so that there are not any extra development and further development is carried easily. 
## Week 8:
### Eliminating Waste:

* Team had integrated all the code, for eliminating the effort of integrating used github, it made the job easy for integrating. While integrating team eliminated unwanted code and kept the code simple to implement the required functionalities.
